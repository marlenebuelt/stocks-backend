# stocks-backend

This repository is the semester project for the webtech class at HTW Berlin. 
My goal is to set up an application that shows relevant data for people interested 
in buying specific stocks. You can enter a WKN number that will be stored in a database 
and by using an API (e.g. https://finnhub.io/docs/api/stock-symbols), current KPIs are updated.
